When you click on the "Generate image and title suggestions" button, the AI will generate the images and possible image titles for you. This can take a few seconds. You will see a loading animation in the meantime.

Image and image title suggestions
---------------------------------

On the second page you see the generated image and image title suggestions. You can select one image and one corresponding title or regenerate the suggestions. The selection will then be added to the content element input field.
