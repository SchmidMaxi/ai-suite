Known problems
==============

There are some issues, which can occur when using the AI Suite. Some of them are nor fixable, because there are outside of our control.

AI responses
==============

Sometimes, the AI somehow does not return a result for your prompt. This can have several reasons:

- The AI is not trained for the specific topic
- The AI is not able to understand the question
- The AI is not able to generate a response
- The AI is not able to connect to the server
- The AI is not able to process the request

We try to minimize the impact of these issues, but we can not guarantee that they will not occur. We try to detect these invalid responses and handle them properly. This means, that we do not charge you a request in those cases.
In most cases, it helps to rephrase your prompt and give some more necessary infos and try again.
